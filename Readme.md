*Vehicle_Object_Detection-using-Keras

As pedestrians taking the dog for a walk, escorting our kids to school, or marching to our workplace in the morning, we’ve all experienced unsafe, fast-moving vehicles operated by inattentive drivers that nearly mow us down.
Many of us live in apartment complexes or housing neighborhoods where ignorant drivers disregard safety and zoom by, going way too fast.
We feel almost powerless. These drivers disregard speed limits, crosswalk areas, school zones, and “children at play” signs altogether. When there is a speed bump, they speed up almost as if they are trying to catch some air!
Is there anything we can do?
In most cases, the answer is unfortunately “no” — we have to look out for ourselves and our families by being careful as we walk in the neighborhoods we live in.

But what if we could catch these reckless neighborhood miscreants in action and provide video evidence of the which vehicle it is and the time of day to local authorities?
